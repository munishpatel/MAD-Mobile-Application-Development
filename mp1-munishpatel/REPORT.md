  - [X] conf/sim5.yaml

## Summary and Reflection

For this queueing simulator MP1, I made several notable implementation decisions. The `simulator.dart` correctly processes three types of processes: Singleton,Periodic, Stochastic as subclasses in `processes.dart`. The `run` method was designed to iterate over a combined queue of all events generated by the configured processes, and the `printReport` method was implemented to generate the expected simulation traces accurately. For stochastic processes (`sim4.yaml` and `sim5.yaml`), the outputs vary between runs due to the random nature of `ExpDistribution`from `stats.dart`. While the implementation is functionally correct, achieving exact matches with the example outputs proved challenging due to the randomness inherent in the exponential distribution. Additionally, I also implemented a verbose mode to provide detailed simulation traces. All core functionality is working as required.

I found implementing the stochastic process with exponential distribution particularly challenging but interesting, as it helped me understand how random number generation affects simulation outcomes. The modular design with different process types (Singleton, Periodic, and Stochastic) was enjoyable to work with, as it demonstrated clear separation of concerns. I wish I had better understood the importance of seed values in random number generation from the start, as it would have helped me grasp why the stochastic process outputs varied between runs.
