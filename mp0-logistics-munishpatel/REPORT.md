## Summary and Reflection

I would say that this is my first time working on flutter and building mobile applications. I always was curious on how the backend of the application work. I have installed flutter SDK in my macOS and also the Xcode for the development. The whole process was simple. When installing the Github Desktop application it asked me choose between contributing to the main repository or the repository with my username on it, I chose the option with my username(mp0-logistics-munishpatel), I hope I did the right thing. 

I really enjoyed the interface of flutter applications. I was really exited to build my demo test_drive application and learn how to work along with the code in dart programming. I wish that I had knowledge about working with Github and contributing to opensource platform. I am ready to learn how to use github in upcoming machine problems. Also the instructions given were very clear on how to commit and submit the assignment.
